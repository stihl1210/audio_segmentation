# audio_segmentation


This repository is a brief presentation prepared by me for AI Roadshow Lublin 22.11.2018 r. 

- this is an introduction to audio segmentation
- presentation is in HTML file
- code is ready to reuse
- K-means clustering can be applied to embeddings
- There are several ways to extract embeddings, i used very naive way to extract them using pretrained classifier
- 3 seconds for selected dataset is not much, also features (SFTF) could be changed into something more reliable
